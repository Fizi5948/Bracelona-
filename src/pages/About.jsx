            FC Barcelona, Spanish professional football (soccer) club located in
            Barcelona. <br /> FC Barcelona is renowned for its historically
            skillful and <br />
            attractive brand of attacking football that places an emphasis on{" "}
            flowing, open play.
            <br /> The team is part of a wider sports and social club 
            with thousands of members. <br />
            <br /> FC Barcelona was formed in 1899 by <br />
            businessman Joan Gamper, who advertised for players in a local{" "}
            <br />
            Barcelona sports magazine.
            <br /> The club’s first trophy was the Copa Macaya (Catalan
            championship) in 1902,
            <br /> and in 1910 “Barça” won the Copa del Rey (“King’s
            Cup”)—Spain’s leading national football cup <br />
            competition—for the first time.
            <br /> In total, Barcelona has won 30 Copas del Rey, more than any
            other team.
            <br /> La Liga, the top Spanish football league, was formed in 1929,{" "}
            <br /> and Barcelona captured the title in the league’s inaugural
            season.
            <br /> The club has won La Liga 26 times and has never been
            relegated to a lower division.
            <br /> Abroad, Barcelona has won the European Cup Winners’ <br />{" "}
            Cup four times (1979, 1982, 1989, and 1997),
            <br />
            the European Cup/Champions League five times (1992, 2006, 2009,
            2011,
            <br />
            and 2015), and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)
            <br />
            Super Cup three times (1992, 1997, and 2009).
            <br /> In 2008–09 it won the La Liga championship, the Copa del Rey,
            <br /> and the continental championship (Champions League) <br />
            to become the first Spanish side to capture this <br />
            “treble,” a feat it repeated in 2014–15.

            Barcelona played its home matches from 1922 to 1957 at the Camp de
            Les Corts.
            <br /> After the increasingly popular club outgrew that facility,{" "}
            <br /> a giant new stadium, Camp Nou, was built in the western part
            of the city and opened in 1957.
            <br /> A stadium-record 120,000 fans watched the 1986 <br />
            European Cup quarterfinal between Barcelona and Juventus.
            <br />
            Barcelona’s local adversary is RCD Espanyol, but its biggest rival
            in Spain is Real Madrid. <br />
            Games between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico (“The
            Classic”) and attract major interest throughout
            <br />
            Spain, in large part because the two sides symbolize for many the
            <br />
            ongoing political and cultural difficulties between Catalonian{" "}
            <br />
            (Barcelona) and Castilian (Real Madrid) Spain.
            <br /> In addition to a long
            <br />
            history of signing some of the football world’s biggest
            <br />
            names—including Johan Cruyff in the 1970s, Diego Maradona in 1980s,
            <br />
            Luis Figo and Rivaldo in the 1990s, <br />
            and Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto’o in the 2000s—Barcelona also has
            developed a number of its own stars,
            <br /> such as Xavi and Argentinian forward Lionel Messi (a football
            prodigy
            <br /> who at age 24 became the club’s all-time leading goal
            scorer).
            <br /> Many of the club’s players have contributed to the Spanish
            national team’s
            <br />
            greatest successes, <br /> including capturing the 2008 and 2012
            European
            <br />
            Championships and the 2010 World Cup.
            <br /> In the 2010 World Cup final, for example, 7 of Spain’s 11
            starters were from Barça.
